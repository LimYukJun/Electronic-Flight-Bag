EFB for General Aviation use in Flight Simulators

This app made for iPad allows Flight Simulator Pilots who fly General Aviation Aircrafts to have access to physical, interactive checklists on their devices. It is also a one-stop place to find charts locations, to use a scratchpad and to open up simbrief. 

Currently checklists are for:
1. Carenado m20r
2. Hondajet HA420
3. And more on the way!
